# Task Table Variants

Task Table Variants is a dynamic application that offers two distinct views for managing tasks. Utilizing React, SCSS, and Bootstrap, this app presents users with two different table options for task organization based on window size adjustments.

Variant 1 - Scrolled Table:
In this variant, the table horizontally scrolls as the browser window size decreases. It ensures that all task details remain accessible and navigable, allowing users to view and interact with the complete dataset conveniently.

Variant 2 - Responsive Table:
The second variant introduces a responsive design to the table. As the browser window shrinks, the table transforms its appearance to suit the available space, optimizing task visibility and readability without the need for horizontal scrolling. This view adapts the task representation for better usability on smaller screens.

## Features

Dual Table Variants: Choose between a horizontally scrolled table or a responsive table based on browser window size.
SCSS and Bootstrap: Enhance styling and responsiveness for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
